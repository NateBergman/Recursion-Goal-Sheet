//Write a recursive method called writeSquares that accepts an integer parameter n and prints the first n squares separated by commas, with the odd squares in descending order followed by the even squares in ascending order.
// For example, writeSquares(8); prints the following output: 49, 25, 9, 1, 4, 16, 36, 64

//Write a modified version of the selection sort algorithm that selects the largest element each time and moves it to the end of the array, rather than selecting the smallest element and moving it to
// the beginning. Will this algorithm be faster than the standard selection sort? What will its complexity class (big-O) be?

//Write a program that reads a series of input lines and sorts them into alphabetical order, ignoring the case of words. The program should use the merge sort algorithm so that it efficiently sorts even a large file.
